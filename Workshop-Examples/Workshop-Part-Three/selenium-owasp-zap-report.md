## Alert Detail


  
  
  
### Reverse Tabnabbing
##### Medium (Medium)
  
  
  
  
#### Description
<p>At least one link on this page is vulnerable to Reverse tabnabbing as it uses a target attribute without using both of the "noopener" and "noreferrer" keywords in the "rel" attribute, which allows the target page to take control of this page.</p>
  
  
  
* URL: [https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login](https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login)
  
  
  * Method: `GET`
  
  
  * Evidence: `<a target="_blank" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10"> OWASP Top 10</a>`
  
  
  
  
Instances: 1
  
### Solution
<p>Do not use a target attribute, or if you have to then also add the attribute: rel="noopener noreferrer".</p>

#### Source ID : 3

  
  
  
### X-Frame-Options Header Not Set
##### Medium (Medium)
  
  
  
  
#### Description
<p>X-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks.</p>
  
  
  
* URL: [https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login](https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login)
  
  
  * Method: `GET`
  
  
  * Parameter: `X-Frame-Options`
  
  
  
  
Instances: 1
  
### Solution
<p>Most modern Web browsers support the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. Ensure it's set on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. ALLOW-FROM allows specific websites to frame the web page in supported web browsers).</p>

### Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
##### Low (Medium)
  
  
  
  
#### Description
<p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.</p>
  
  
  
* URL: [https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login](https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login)
  
  
  * Method: `GET`
  
  
  
  
Instances: 1
  
### Solution
<p>Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header, to achieve optimal browser support: "Content-Security-Policy" for Chrome 25+, Firefox 23+ and Safari 7+, "X-Content-Security-Policy" for Firefox 4.0+ and Internet Explorer 10+, and "X-WebKit-CSP" for Chrome 14+ and Safari 6+.</p>

#### Source ID : 3

  
  
  
### Cookie Without SameSite Attribute
##### Low (Medium)
  
  
  
  
#### Description
<p>A cookie has been set without the SameSite attribute, which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a 'cross-site' request. The SameSite attribute is an effective counter measure to cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion, and timing attacks.</p>
  
  
  
* URL: [https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/](https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/)
  
  
  * Method: `GET`
  
  
  * Parameter: `connect.sid`
  
  
  * Evidence: `Set-Cookie: connect.sid`
  
  
  
  
Instances: 1
  
### Solution
<p>Ensure that the SameSite attribute is set to either 'lax' or ideally 'strict' for all cookies.</p>

#### CWE Id : 16
  
#### WASC Id : 13
  
#### Source ID : 3

  
  
  
### Cookie Without Secure Flag
##### Low (Medium)
  
  
  
  
#### Description
<p>A cookie has been set without the secure flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed via unencrypted connections.</p>
  
  
  
* URL: [https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/](https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/)
  
  
  * Method: `GET`
  
  
  * Parameter: `connect.sid`
  
  
  * Evidence: `Set-Cookie: connect.sid`
  
  
  
  
Instances: 1
  
### Solution
<p>Whenever a cookie contains sensitive information or is a session token, then it should always be passed using an encrypted channel. Ensure that the secure flag is set for cookies containing such sensitive information.</p>

#### WASC Id : 13
  
#### Source ID : 3

  
  
  
### Incomplete or No Cache-control and Pragma HTTP Header Set
##### Low (Medium)
  
  
  
  
#### Description
<p>The cache-control and pragma HTTP header have not been set properly or are missing allowing the browser and proxies to cache content.</p>
  
  
  
* URL: [https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login](https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login)
  
  
  * Method: `GET`
  
  
  * Parameter: `Cache-Control`
  
  
  
  
Instances: 1
  
### Solution
<p>Whenever possible ensure the cache-control HTTP header is set with no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate; and that the pragma HTTP header is set with no-cache.</p>

#### Source ID : 3

  
  
  
### Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP Response Header Field(s)
##### Low (Medium)
  
  
  
  
#### Description
<p>The web/application server is leaking information via one or more "X-Powered-By" HTTP response headers. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other frameworks/components your web application is reliant upon and the vulnerabilities such components may be subject to.</p>
  
  
  
* URL: [https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/](https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/)
  
  
  * Method: `GET`
  
  
  * Evidence: `X-Powered-By: Express`
  
  
  
  
* URL: [https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login](https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login)
  
  
  * Method: `GET`
  
  
  * Evidence: `X-Powered-By: Express`
  
  
  
  
Instances: 2
  
### Solution
<p>Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress "X-Powered-By" headers.</p>

#### CWE Id : 200
  
#### WASC Id : 13
  
#### Source ID : 3

  
  
  
### Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set
##### Low (High)
  
  
  
  
#### Description
<p>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL). HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.</p>
  
  
  
* URL: [https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login](https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login)
  
  
  * Method: `GET`
  
  
  
  
Instances: 1
  
### Solution
<p>Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to enforce Strict-Transport-Security.</p>

#### CWE Id : 16
  
#### WASC Id : 15
  
#### Source ID : 3

  
  
  
### X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
##### Low (Medium)
  
  
  
  
#### Description
<p>The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.</p>
  
  
  
* URL: [https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login](https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login)
  
  
  * Method: `GET`
  
  
  * Parameter: `X-Content-Type-Options`
  
  
  
  
Instances: 1
  
### Solution
<p>Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.</p><p>If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.</p>
  
### Other information
<p>This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.</p><p>At "High" threshold this scanner will not alert on client or server error responses.</p>

### Modern Web Application
##### Informational (Medium)
  
  
  
  
#### Description
<p>The application appears to be a modern web application. If you need to explore it automatically then the Ajax Spider may well be more effective than the standard one.</p>
  
  
  
* URL: [https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login](https://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/login)
  
  
  * Method: `GET`
  
  
  * Evidence: `<a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" style="font-size: larger"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></a>`
  
  
  
  
Instances: 1
  
### Solution
<p>This is an informational alert and so no changes are required.</p>
  
### Other information
<p>Links have been found that do not have traditional href attributes, which is an indication that this is a modern web application.</p>
